            I Completed React JS with Redux course from VLR training which was taught by Praveen sir. His way of teaching is very good and understandable. He always  motivate the students and explanation of basic concepts are very impressive. Being a Non-IT student with career gap with lots of questions in my mind joined in VLR .Praveen sir teaches each and every topics from very basic level (simply I can spoon feeding) ,Now I got enough confident and gained a very good knowledge on REACT,REDUX as well as JavaScript ( including ES6) Big Thanks to Praveen sir. I strongly recommending VLR training for freshers

            I would like to share my personal experience joining VLR Training. They are not money oriented and have great course packages.

            Praveen Sir is well networked with the IT industry and companies in Hyderabad.

            VLR Training is the best training institute. If you want to join IT industry and you have no IT skills or experience, or you are having a career gap and looking to restart your career, VLR Training is where you have to approach.

            It is the best place where you can acquire all knowledge both theoretical and practical(Hands-on) with projects and project like case studies.

            I would like to tell about my personal experience. I have career gap and wanted to pursue my career in IT.

            I came to know about the institute through  a cousin searched  for a lot of institutes and reviews on them and finally made up my mind to joinVLR Training .

            I think joining VLR Training .
            was the best part of all.

            The training you get here is most efficient and the enthusiasm you find in the trainer (Praveen.G Sir) to train you from the scratch is something which you can exceptionally find in VLR Training.

            Praveen Sir (The trainer ) have a lot of industry exposure and can mold you to current IT trends.

            Here they not just train you on the courses you enroll, but also prepare you to attend your interviews with confidence.

            So for those who want to start fresh and those who would like enhance their skills and learn trendy IT course, VLR Training is the one stop solution
